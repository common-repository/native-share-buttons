If you want to place the active buttons only in selected posts, use the [really_simple_share] shortcode.

If you want to place only one share button, add the *button* attribute to the shortcode, e.g.:

* [really_simple_share button="facebook_like"]
* [really_simple_share button="twitter"]
* [really_simple_share button="linkedin"]
* [really_simple_share button="pinterest"]
* [really_simple_share button="google1"]
* [really_simple_share button="digg"]
* [really_simple_share button="stumbleupon"]
* [really_simple_share button="reddit"]
* [really_simple_share button="flattr"]
* [really_simple_share button="tumblr"]
* [really_simple_share button="facebook_share"]
* and so on...

Please note that in order to place single share buttons, they have to be active in the plugin settings page.
